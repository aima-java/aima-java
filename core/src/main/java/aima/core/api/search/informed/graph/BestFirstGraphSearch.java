 * Best-first graph search is an instance of the general GRAPH-SEARCH algorithm in
 * which a node is selected for expansion based on an evaluation function, <em>f(n)</em>.
 * The evaluation function is construed as a cost estimate, so the node with the lowest
 * evaluation is expanded first. The implementation of best-first graph search is identical
 * to that for uniform-cost search (Figure ?.??), except for the use of <em>f</em> instead
 * of <em>g</em> to order the priority queue.
